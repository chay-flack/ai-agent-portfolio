## AI & Automation Pre-Flight Governance Framework

This repository contains a practical governance artefact used to assess AI systems,
automation, and agents **before they are relied upon** in regulated environments.

## What this is

This artefact is a practical governance framework for AI systems, automation, and agents operating in regulated, decision-critical environments.

It is designed to ensure that:
- system intent is explicit
- accountability is clear
- workflow integration is understood
- risks and failure modes are surfaced before systems are relied upon

---

## Why this exists

In large institutions, governance failures in AI and automation rarely stem from:
- model performance
- algorithmic sophistication

They arise from:
- unclear ownership
- poor workflow integration
- lack of monitoring and escalation
- governance applied after systems are already live

This framework introduces a **pre-flight governance check** — a structured review conducted before an AI or automation system is relied upon in practice.

---

## What “pre-flight” means

Pre-flight governance is a **design-time and go-live control** that asks:

- Where does this system sit in the end-to-end process?
- What decisions does it influence?
- Who is accountable when it fails?
- How is it monitored?
- Who can stop it?

The objective is **decision integrity**, not compliance theatre.

## What’s included

The workbook contains two forms:

### Lite Governance Form
- Used for early experiments and prototypes
- Proportional governance
- Fast to complete
- Encourages safe exploration

### Full Governance Form
- Used for systems approaching production
- Workflow-anchored
- Explicit ownership and escalation
- Suitable for regulated environments

---

## How it’s used in practice

1. Select Lite or Full form based on system maturity  
2. Complete the form at design time  
3. Review as part of pre-flight approval  
4. Use it as an anchor for monitoring and change management  
5. Upgrade Lite → Full as scope, autonomy, or reliance increases

## Positioning

This artefact reflects my focus on **AI governance, operating models, and senior decision-making**, rather than tool-building for its own sake.

It is representative of how I think about:
- AI risk
- accountability
- judgement
- governance in real institutions
