## AI Operational Specification (AI-OPS) Framework

This repository describes a practical framework for defining, approving, and governing
what “good” operation looks like for AI systems and automated workflows in a banking
and regulated environment.

The framework establishes a clear, immutable reference for authorised behaviour,
decision boundaries, and escalation expectations once an AI system is commissioned.

---

## What this is

The AI Operational Specification (AI-OPS) framework defines the **approved operating
parameters** for an AI system or workflow.

It describes:
- what the system is allowed to do
- what it must not do
- what data and systems it may access
- what outputs are expected and acceptable
- how failure and uncertainty are handled

AI-OPS acts as the authoritative reference against which pre-flight checks,
operational monitoring, and assurance activities are performed.

---

## Why this exists

In practice, AI governance often fails because expectations are implicit rather than explicit.

Common issues include:
- unclear boundaries between decision support and decision execution
- silent expansion of scope over time
- disagreement about what constitutes acceptable behaviour
- monitoring that detects change but cannot assess materiality
- difficulty demonstrating what was approved “at the time”

The AI-OPS framework addresses these gaps by making operating expectations explicit,
reviewable, and governable.

---

## Role within the AI governance lifecycle

AI-OPS sits at the centre of the AI governance lifecycle:

- Pre-flight governance uses AI-OPS to assess readiness and authorisation
- Operational oversight uses AI-OPS as the benchmark for detecting drift or deviation
- Change management uses AI-OPS to assess the impact of updates or extensions
- Assurance and audit use AI-OPS to evidence approved operating conditions

Without a clear operational specification, oversight and governance become subjective.

---

## Scope of an operational specification

An AI-OPS artefact typically defines:

- system purpose and scope
- authorised and prohibited actions
- decision authority and autonomy level
- data inputs and access boundaries
- expected outputs and confidence expectations
- tolerance thresholds for variance, drift, or latency
- known failure modes and escalation requirements
- conditions requiring pause, rollback, or re-approval

The level of detail should be proportionate to system risk and reliance.

---

## Immutability and control

A core principle of the framework is that AI-OPS must be **stable during operation**.

This means:
- AI systems must not be able to modify their own specification
- changes to AI-OPS require formal review and approval
- versioning and effective dates are explicit
- historical specifications remain available for review

This ensures that oversight is anchored to what was actually approved at a point in time.

---

## Relationship to human accountability

AI-OPS explicitly allocates responsibility by making expectations unambiguous.

It supports:
- clear ownership of system outcomes
- informed approval and risk acceptance
- decisive escalation when boundaries are crossed
- defensible intervention decisions

Where responsibility is unclear, AI-OPS is treated as incomplete.

---

## What this framework is not

This framework does not:
- replace model development documentation
- prescribe implementation architecture
- attempt to optimise model performance
- act as a policy or compliance checklist

Its purpose is operational clarity and governance integrity.

---

## Status

This framework is currently in **design and early prototyping**.

Initial focus areas include:
- defining a practical AI-OPS template
- testing how specifications are used in pre-flight checks
- validating how effectively specifications anchor monitoring and drift detection

---

## Positioning

This framework reflects a focus on **AI governance by construction**, where
expectations, authority, and accountability are defined before reliance begins.

It is intended for use by business owners, operational teams, risk and compliance
functions, and senior decision-makers responsible for approving and overseeing
AI-enabled systems.
