# Agents

This directory contains individual AI agent prototypes.

Each agent focuses on a specific problem or workflow, with an emphasis on:
- Clear problem framing
- Simple, inspectable logic
- Practical considerations around control, risk, and failure modes

Agents are intentionally lightweight and exploratory.
