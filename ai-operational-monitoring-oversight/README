## AI Operational Oversight & Monitoring Framework

This repository describes a practical framework for providing ongoing oversight, monitoring,
and intervention capability for AI systems and automated workflows operating within a
large financial institution.

The framework is designed to support continuous governance, decision integrity, and
clear accountability once AI-enabled systems are live and relied upon in regulated,
high-stakes environments.

---

## What this is

This framework defines how a bank maintains **situational awareness and control**
over AI-enabled systems during operation.

It focuses on ensuring that AI systems:
- continue to operate within approved authority and scope
- behave consistently with their commissioned intent
- remain subject to effective human oversight and intervention
- can be paused, degraded, or withdrawn when risk increases

The emphasis is on **operational governance**, not technical observability alone.

---

## Why this exists

In banking environments, risk associated with AI systems typically emerges
after deployment rather than at the point of approval.

Common failure patterns include:
- gradual behavioural or performance drift
- changes in upstream data or downstream workflows
- expansion of perceived authority beyond approval
- unclear responsibility for intervention
- monitoring that is fragmented across teams or tools

This framework addresses the gap between **initial authorisation** and **ongoing reliance**
on AI-enabled decision processes.

---

## Relationship to lifecycle governance and AI-OPS

Operational oversight operates in conjunction with:
- lifecycle governance and pre-flight controls
- an approved AI Operational Specification (AI-OPS)

AI-OPS defines what “good” operation looks like.
Operational oversight monitors live behaviour **against that specification**.

Drift, anomalies, and breaches are assessed relative to approved operating boundaries,
not in isolation.

---

## Scope of oversight

The framework supports oversight across:
- individual AI agents
- multi-agent workflows
- AI-enabled decision support systems
- automated operational processes embedded in core banking activities

It applies to both:
- systems transitioning from experimentation to production
- systems already operating with material business or customer impact

---

## Core oversight capabilities

Effective operational oversight requires:
- visibility of system and workflow health
- detection of behavioural, performance, or authority drift
- identification of anomalies or unexpected outcomes
- escalation pathways aligned to business and risk ownership
- authority to pause, degrade, or roll back operation
- evidence capture to support assurance, review, and audit

The framework does not prescribe specific tools or platforms.

---

## Human accountability and intervention

A core principle of the framework is that **oversight must be actionable**.

This requires:
- clearly defined ownership of oversight effectiveness
- explicit decision rights to intervene or suspend operation
- human review points for material issues
- traceable records of decisions and outcomes

Monitoring without authority to act is treated as insufficient.

---

## Monitoring cadence and proportionality

Oversight should be proportionate to system risk, autonomy, and reliance.

Supported monitoring modes include:
- scheduled reviews (for example daily or periodic checks)
- event-driven alerts
- ad-hoc investigation
- continuous or near-real-time signals where appropriate

Monitoring intensity should increase as reliance and impact increase.

---

## Evidence and assurance

Operational oversight must produce defensible, time-based evidence.

This includes:
- point-in-time views of system state
- records of alerts, escalations, and interventions
- historical views of behaviour and performance
- linkage to approved AI-OPS and governance artefacts

Evidence should be linked across systems rather than manually reproduced.

---

## What this framework is not

This framework does not:
- prescribe specific monitoring technologies or vendors
- replace approval, risk acceptance, or governance forums
- attempt to solve model development or tuning
- assume full automation of oversight decisions

Its purpose is to enable effective governance and control in practice.

---

## Status

This framework is currently in **design and prototyping**.

Initial focus areas include:
- defining meaningful oversight signals
- clarifying escalation and intervention patterns
- aligning operational monitoring with governance expectations in a banking environment

---

## Positioning

This framework reflects a focus on **AI governance, operating models, and decision accountability**
within large financial institutions.

It is intended to support business owners, operational teams, risk and compliance functions,
and senior leaders responsible for maintaining trust in AI-enabled systems.
