## Conceptual Overview

This diagram illustrates how operational oversight and monitoring fit within the
broader AI governance operating model in a banking environment.

At the base are AI systems and workflows embedded in business processes.
These systems operate within authority and scope defined by lifecycle governance controls.

Above this sits the operational oversight layer, which aggregates monitoring signals,
detects drift or anomalies, and enables escalation and intervention.

Human decision-makers remain explicitly in the loop, with clear ownership of:
- oversight effectiveness
- escalation decisions
- intervention actions

The diagram emphasises separation between:
- AI execution
- monitoring and oversight
- human accountability

Evidence generated through oversight activities is captured and linked to
governance artefacts to support assurance and audit.
