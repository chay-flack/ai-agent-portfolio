# AI Governance, Oversight, and GRC Concepts

This repository contains conceptual exploration, architectural thinking, and early research into AI governance, operational oversight, and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) systems.

The focus is on:
- AI operational oversight and human-in-the-loop controls
- Pre-flight checks and continuous monitoring of AI workflows
- Policy and procedure intelligence
- Regulatory interpretation and traceability
- System-level governance design rather than point solutions

## Scope and Intent

This repository is intentionally **conceptual**.

It reflects personal thinking, experimentation, and design exploration rather than a production-ready system, reference implementation, or compliance solution. Any practical application would require further design, validation, testing, and organisational tailoring.

Content here is shared to:
- Document and refine ideas
- Support discussion with peers, clients, and interviewers
- Explore emerging challenges in AI governance and oversight

## Status

Work in progress. Ideas may evolve, be refined, or be deprioritised over time.
